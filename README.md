# PneumoniaClassifier

The idea of the project was to create a classifier to identifiy pneumonia based on X-ray images.

The data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

There are two jupyter notebooks one with self-implemented custom CNN and the other with pretrained ResNet50 CNN.

The overall accuracy of the models is around 80%, and the perfomance is yet to be honed.
